# Seam-Carving

---

## Project Introduction

This project is one of THU Computer Graphics Course's projects. Actually this is the third project of the course. This project's goal is to recurrent a paper, [Recurrent Seam carving for content-aware image resizing](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1276390).

This project is finished in June 2018 but I upload it in December 2018. The main reason is that I'd like to use this project to practice how to write CMakeList and use it to compile.
